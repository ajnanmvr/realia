          "REALIA'23" is the name of this year's Rabee' festival, organized by
          the Al Huda Students' Association (ASAs), the U.G. Students' Union of
          Darul Huda Islamic University. In a rapidly evolving contemporary
          context rife with falsehoods and fake news, REALIA'23 aims to uncover
          and present the truth and facts.
